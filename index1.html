            <p>The CAPTCHA DESIGN FESTIVAL will be taking place for the 7th time this August. It is organized by students of the University of Applied Sciences Mannheim. </p>
            <p>Meeting this year in Mannheim might be impossible for most of us. Yet, Captcha is an amazing event and we will not cancel it. Therefore we have decided to provide you with a virtual Captcha Version. True to our tradition, there will be an
                initial single-day symposium, a following week of four different workshops, and a final virtual exhibition. Workshop leaders and participants worldwide connect and communicate via digital tools. We are eagerly working on creating a virtual
                experience close to real life.

        <h2>HABITAT</h2>
        <div class="text">
            <div class="blue">from lat. habitāre | [ˈhæb.ə.tæt]</div>
            <p>This year's topic for the festival is <span class="font-blue">HABITAT</span>. In a biological context, the term is used to describe the natural environment for living organisms of all kinds. As we inhabit cities and villages, microorganisms
                such as bacteria and viruses inhabit us.</p>

            <p>In our modern society especially during the ongoing pandemic, <span class="font-blue">we do not simply
                    live in the natural, real
                    world</span>. Our minds have merged with another non-physical habitat: the digital one. Within our online design festival Captcha 2020 we create spheres in which we explore the limits, variety and endangering of habitats.</p>
